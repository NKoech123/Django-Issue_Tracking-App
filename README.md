# Issue Tracker

This is a simple issue tracking django app still undergoing development. This application is intended to assist project members, with various dependent 
teams/departments, in tracking and managing issues. The application enabled me to practice CRUD functionalities

# Data Model:
Since effective project planning is key to completing any project in time and under budget, I developed some data management
and presentation functions.
  Users can:
           1)Create,read, update and delete both  projects and issues
           2.Open issues per project
